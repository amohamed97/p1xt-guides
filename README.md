| Complete a [Specialization](#specializations) - note: you will have the opportunity to complete a specialization in each tier so don't worry overmuch about picking 'the right one'. That said, if you didn't do App Academy in Tier 0 [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - App Academy Open](./specializations/app_academy_open.md) is highly recommended. |            |
